# Installing PEAK
Here we are going to teach you how to install PEAK. 

Firstly, you need to install Python v3.9.6. After that, you can install PEAK by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command like this:
```bash
$ pip install peak-mas
```
Another way to install PEAK is via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). For that, you can download the env.yml file from the repository, and type these commands in the terminal:
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate peak
```
Test if it is well installed by using one of the commands bellow:
```bash
$ peak
$ python -m peak
```
Now you are ready to go!
