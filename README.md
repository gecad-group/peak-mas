PEAK is a multi-agent system framework which helps the users develop, monitor, analyze and maintain ecosystem of heterogeneous agent communities. This ecosystem is  where various multi-agent systems can coexist, interact and share resources between them. 
This framework is based on <a href="https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">SPADE</a>.


## Prerequisites

- Python == 3.9.6
- XMPP Server ([see docs](https://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/peak))


## Installing PEAK

### Conda

To install using conda, download the environment.yml file from the repository and then use the following command:
```bash
$ conda env create --file environment.yml	
```
This will create a conda environment called _peak_.

### Pip

To install using pip, just type the following command:
```bash
$ pip install peak-mas
```


## Using PEAK

### Notes on SPADE

As already said PEAK is based on SPADE. This means that every functionality of SPADE is available to the user. We highly recommend you to see <a href="https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">SPADE</a> examples and documentation before starting using PEAK. Once you are familiarized with SPADE's mechanics you can start using PEAK.

### Notes on XMPP

To run any PEAK's agent you will need a XMPP server. You can either configure one on your machine, remotely or use a public server. The only issue with the public servers is that they don't usually have all the configurations required to run some PEAK's functionalities. To configure the server you can read the "Configure XMPP server" section in the <a href="http://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/peak" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

#### Using docker

To make it easier to configure the XMPP server we have created a docker image with the server already configured. To use it just type the following command in the /docker folder:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Hello World Agent Example

One thing that was added in PEAK was the way the user executes the agents. PEAK added a CLI, inspired in JADE, to help the user execute end configure each agent in a easy and intuitive manner.
In this example we will show you how to execute a single agent. Save the following code in a file called `agent.py`.

```python 
from peak import Agent, OneShotBehaviour

class agent(Agent):
    class HelloWorld(OneShotBehaviour):
        async def run(self):
            print("Hello World")
            await self.agent.stop()

    async def setup(self):
        self.add_behaviour(self.HelloWorld())
```
It is necessary that the name of the file is the same as the name of the agent's class so PEAK can do the proper parsing. This agent only has a behavior that prints to the terminal the "Hello World" message. To execute the agent just type the following command:
```bash 
$ peak run path/to/agent.py -j agent@localhost
```
Change the `localhost` to the domain of the XMPP server you want to connect.

## Roadmap

This are some functionalities that are being developed and will be released in a near future:
- [ ] Integrate FIPA ACL messages in PEAK.
- [ ] Add dynamic speed option to PEAK's internal clock.
- [ ] Add multi-threading option to the Command Line Interface.
- [ ] Implement Yellow Page Service in the Directory Facilitator agent.
- [ ] Implement physical mobility in the agents.
